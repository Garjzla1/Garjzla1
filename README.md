- Hi, Iâ€™m @Garjzla1.
- Iâ€™m interested in woodturning, soccer, public speaking, computers, programming, math, and, above all, God (Genesis 1:1). 
I'm a junior in highschool. I have taught myself Python, so please excuse the mess and stupid code (and total lack of comments). I have done a little work in VBA, VB.NET, and Java Script.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... Don't
